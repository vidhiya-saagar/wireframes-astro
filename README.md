# SPG Wireframes - Astro

## Description

This is a repo for a "new"-er SPG website, that you can see on https://beta.spg.dev/books.

This one is built using Astro!

### Why Astro?

The reason we chose Astro is because this app is highly static. The whole application is based on a book (the Suraj Prakash Granth), which lives in a database. The contents of that data isn't really going to change. Meaning, when someone loads `/chapters/123`, it should always load the same page.

And Astro is very good at optimizing these things because it will BUILD these pages in our deployment.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

- Clone and setup [spg2](https://github.com/vidhiya-saagar/spg2) and `rails s` in that repo
- Clone this repo
- Install Node `v22` (e.g. `nvm install 22`)
- Run `yarn install`

### Running Astro Server

Once you have the Rails server running, do:

```
yarn run dev
```

This should open the server on http://localhost:4321/books

## Deployment

This app uses Vercel to deploy over [here](https://vercel.com/is-null/wireframes-astro). For some reason, the Project is named `is-null`. I don't know why, but we should fix that soon lol.

Once something merged, it automatically deploys with Vercel. Ensure we have all the appropriate `env`s setup:

### ENVs

```env
API_URL=http://localhost:1843/

# CONTENTFUL CONFIG
CMS_SPACE_ID=#
CMS_ACCESS_TOKEN=#

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=#
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=#
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=#
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                 | Action                                           |
